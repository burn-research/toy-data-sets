# Data sets composed of hyperplanes

This is a collection of data sets that are composed of manifolds of dimensionality one less than the data dimensionality.

## 2D data sets

This [**Jupyter notebook**](hyperplanes-2D-data-sets.ipynb) can be used to generate various 1D manifolds embedded in a 2D space.
